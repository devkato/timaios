Timaios
 - yet another dynamic web server.

This project's idea is
 - Minimal high performance HTTP server with epoll module.
 - Don't think about porting(only Linux platform).
 - Don't serve static contents. There are already great projects such as lighttpd(http://www.lighttpd.net/), nginx(http://nginx.org/).
 - All request endpoint is created by the way of "plugin", even if "/".
 - Don't depend on other libraries to minimize code.
 - Don't have to implement complete HTTP server: Get something and return something.
 - Don't use frondend, use backend only.


Keywords:
 - HTTP Server
 - Non-Blocking
 - epoll
 - readv/writev
