Timaios
 - yet another dynamic web server.

This project's idea is
 - Minimal high performance HTTP server with epoll module.
 - Don't worry about porting(only Linux platform).
 - Don't serve static contents. There are already great project such as lighttpd(http://www.lighttpd.net/), nginx(http://nginx.org/).
 - All request endpoint is created by the way of "plugin", even if "/".
